Boomerang: Metadata-Private Messaging under Hardware Trust.,Peipei Jiang 0002; Qian Wang 0002; Jianhao Cheng; Cong Wang 0001; Lei Xu 0019; Xinyu Wang 0007; Yihao Wu; Xiaoyuan Li; Kui Ren 0001,2023,NSDI,https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi23/presentation/jiang,https://dblp.org/db/conf/nsdi/nsdi2023.html#00020C0XWWL023,"In end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) messaging systems, protecting communication metadata, such as who is communicating with whom, at what time, etc., remains a challenging problem. Existing designs mostly fall into the balancing act among security, performance, and trust assumptions: 1) designs with cryptographic security often use hefty operations, incurring performance roadblocks and expensive operational costs for large-scale deployment; 2) more performant systems often follow a weaker security guarantee, like differential privacy, and generally demand more trust from the involved servers. So far, there has been no dominant solution. In this paper, we take a different technical route from prior art, and propose Boomerang, an alternative metadata-private messaging system leveraging the readily available trust assumption on secure enclaves (as those emerging in the cloud). Through a number of carefully tailored oblivious techniques on message shuffling, workload distribution, and proactive patching of the communication pattern, Boomerang brings together low latency, horizontal scalability, and cryptographic security, without prohibitive extra cost. With 32 machines, Boomerang achieves 99th percentile latency of 7.76 seconds for 220clients. We hope Boomerang offers attractive alternative options to the current landscape of metadata-private messaging designs."
Verification and Redesign of OFDM Backscatter.,Xin Liu 0045; Zicheng Chi; Wei Wang 0190; Yao Yao 0009; Pei Hao; Ting Zhu 0001,2021,NSDI,https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi21/presentation/liu-xin,https://dblp.org/db/conf/nsdi/nsdi2021.html#0045C00HZ21,"Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) has been widely used in WiFi, LTE, and adopted in 5G. Recently, researchers have proposed multiple OFDM-based WiFi backscatter systems that use the same underlying design principle (i.e., codeword translation) at the OFDM symbol-level to transmit the tag data. However, since the phase error correction in WiFi receivers can eliminate the phase offset created by a tag, the codeword translation requires specific WiFi receivers that can disable the phase error correction. As a result, phase error is introduced into the decoding procedure of the codeword translation, which significantly increases the tag data decoding error. To address this issue, we designed a novel OFDM backscatter called TScatter, which uses high-granularity sample-level modulation to avoid the phase offset created by a tag being eliminated by phase error correction. Moreover, by taking advantage of the phase error correction, our system is able to work in more dynamic environments. Our design also has two advantages: much lower BER and higher throughput. We conducted extensive evaluations under different scenarios. The experimental results show that TScatter has i) three to four orders of magnitude lower BER when its throughput is similar to the latest OFDM backscatter system MOXcatter; or ii) more than 212 times higher throughput when its BER is similar to MOXcatter. Our design is generic and has the potential to be applied to backscatter other OFDM signals (e.g., LTE and 5G)."
AutoCCL: Automated Collective Communication Tuning for Accelerating Distributed and Parallel DNN Training.,Guanbin Xu; Zhihao Le; Yinhe Chen; Zhiqi Lin; Zewen Jin; Youshan Miao; Cheng Li,2025,NSDI,https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi25/presentation/xu-guanbin,https://dblp.org/db/conf/nsdi/nsdi2025.html#XuLCLJML25,"The collective communication libraries are pivotal in optimizing the performance of distributed and parallel deep neural network (DNN) training. Most network optimizations are under the assumption that these libraries are well-tuned, ignoring their low-level parameter selection. In this paper, we present a novel automated tuning method AutoCCL that significantly improves communication performance without incurring additional costs. One of the primary challenges we tackle is the state explosion in searching for the optimal configuration. To overcome this, we decouple implementation-related parameters from those sensitive to the search space size and propose a divide-and-conquer algorithm, minimizing the requirement for exhaustive trials. We further propose an online tuning approach that accounts for communication-computation interference to enhance accuracy in finding optimal configurations, while hiding tuning overhead within early iterations of training jobs. We implement AutoCCL atop NCCL, a leading and widely-used communication library provided by NVIDIA. Our evaluation on both a 2-node cluster (16 A40 GPUs, intra-node NVLink, inter-node 2× 400Gbps InfiniBand) and a 4-node cluster (32 A40 GPUs, intra-node PCIe, inter-node 100Gbps InfiniBand) demonstrates that AutoCCL achieves 1.24-1.29× and 1.15-1.22× speedups on microbenchmarks compared to NCCL and another SOTA NCCL tuner, respectively, and up to 1.80× and 1.49× with concurrent computation. End-to-end evaluations on three large language models and one vision model show 1.07-1.32× improvements in periteration training time."
Rex: Preventing Bugs and Misconfiguration in Large Services Using Correlated Change Analysis.,Sonu Mehta; Ranjita Bhagwan; Rahul Kumar 0002; Chetan Bansal; Chandra Shekhar Maddila; Balasubramanyan Ashok; Sumit Asthana; Christian Bird; Aditya Kumar,2020,NSDI,https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/mehta,https://dblp.org/db/conf/nsdi/nsdi2020.html#MehtaB0BMAABK20,"Large services experience extremely frequent changes to code and configuration. In many cases, these changes are correlated across files. For example, an engineer introduces a new feature following which they also change a configuration file to enable the feature only on a small number of experimental machines. This example captures only one of numerous types of correlations that emerge organically in large services. Unfortunately, in almost all such cases, no documentation or specification guides engineers on how to make correlated changes and they often miss making them. Such misses can be vastly disruptive to the service.We have designed and deployed Rex, a tool that, using a combination of machine learning and program analysis, learnschange-rulesthat capture such correlations. When an engineer changes only a subset of files in a change-rule, Rex suggests additional changes to the engineer based on the change-rule. Rex has been deployed for 14 months on 360 repositories within Microsoft that hold code and configuration for services such as Office 365 and Azure. Rex has so far positively affected 4926 changes without which, at the very least, code-quality would have degraded and, in some cases, the service would have been severely disrupted."
PowerTCP: Pushing the Performance Limits of Datacenter Networks.,Vamsi Addanki; Oliver Michel; Stefan Schmid 0001,2022,NSDI,https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi22/presentation/addanki,https://dblp.org/db/conf/nsdi/nsdi2022.html#AddankiM022,"Increasingly stringent throughput and latency requirements in datacenter networks demand fast and accurate congestion control. We observe that the reaction time and accuracy of existing datacenter congestion control schemes are inherently limited. They either rely only on explicit feedback about the network state (e.g., queue lengths in DCTCP) or only on variations of state (e.g., RTT gradient in TIMELY). To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel congestion control algorithm, PowerTCP, which achieves much more fine-grained congestion control by adapting to the bandwidth-window product (henceforth called power). PowerTCP leverages in-band network telemetry to react to changes in the network instantaneously without loss of throughput and while keeping queues short. Due to its fast reaction time, our algorithm is particularly well-suited for dynamic network environments and bursty traffic patterns. We show analytically and empirically that PowerTCP can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in both traditional datacenter topologies and emerging reconfigurable datacenters where frequent bandwidth changes make congestion control challenging. In traditional datacenter networks, PowerTCP reduces tail flow completion times of short flows by 80% compared to DCQCN and TIMELY, and by 33% compared to HPCC even at 60% network load. In reconfigurable datacenters, PowerTCP achieves 85% circuit utilization without incurring additional latency and cuts tail latency by at least 2x compared to existing approaches."
